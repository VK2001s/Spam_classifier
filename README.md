# Spam_classifier
## Objective
This project aims to create an SMS spam classifier utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to accurately classify incoming SMS messages as either spam or ham (non-spam). By identifying spam messages, users can avoid unwanted and potentially harmful content in their SMS communications.

## Software and Tools Requirements

Python
Jupyter Notebook (or any Python IDE)
Libraries: NLTK, Scikit-Learn, Pandas, NumPy

## Dataset

The project uses an SMS dataset containing labeled examples of both spam and ham messages. The dataset typically includes two columns:

'Text': The SMS text content.
'Label': The label indicating whether the message is spam ('spam') or ham ('ham').
NLP Techniques

## Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques are applied to preprocess the text data. These techniques may include:

Tokenization: Breaking text into words or phrases.
Text Cleaning: Removing punctuation, stopwords, and special characters.
Text Vectorization: Converting text into numerical form (e.g., TF-IDF or Word Embeddings).
Machine Learning Model

The heart of the SMS spam classifier is a machine learning model, often based on algorithms like Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), or more advanced deep learning models like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).
I have used Multinomial Naive Bayes because of it's good accuracy and precision.

## Training and Testing

The dataset is typically split into a training set and a testing set. The model is trained on the training set and evaluated on the testing set to assess its accuracy and performance in classifying SMS messages.

## Results

The SMS spam classifier aims to provide a valuable service by filtering out unwanted spam messages, enhancing the SMS experience for users. It can be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to measure its effectiveness in correctly classifying spam and ham messages.

This project allows for experimentation with different NLP techniques and machine learning models to improve classification accuracy and ensure that spam messages are accurately identified while minimizing false positives (misclassifying ham as spam). The ultimate goal is to enhance SMS communication by reducing unwanted and potentially harmful content.
